# Mission Planning Optimization
Problem similar to prize-collecting TSP solved with implementation of branch &amp; bound and simplex algorithm
as a project for the course of Combinatorial Decision Making and Optimization (Master's degree in AI) of University of Bologna.

Tested on python3.8.

## Installation
```
python3 -m pip install numpy
```

## Use
Example.py contains an example of usage of the package Mission Optimizer, in order to run do:
```
python3 example.py
```
The path which maximizes the collected price, while minimizing the cost and keeping the energy 
and time requirements under the given thresholds, will be printed on the terminal.

## Details
More information can be found in the pdf report available in the repository.
